First I had to navigate to the admin panel, once there I clicked on 'agents' then 'roles' and selected "supreme admin". For the Department configuration the steps were similar: Admin panel ->Agents -> Departments. For Teams it was Admin panel ->Agents ->Teams. For Agents it was Admin panel ->Agents ->Add new. For users it was Agent Panel ->Users ->Add New. To allow anyone to create tickets it was Admin Panel ->Settings ->User Settings. Lastly for SLA it was Admin Panel ->Manage ->SLA.
